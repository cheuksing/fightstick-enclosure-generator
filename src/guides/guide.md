#### Enclousure Parts

The generated enclosure includes following parts:
  - clear plate (for artwork)
  - top plate
  - bottom plate
  - standoff (at 4 corners)
  - side plates
  - brook pcb standoff (optional)

All plates except clear plate are expected to be thicker than 4mm.

###### Screws
All screws being used on the enclourse are M4 screws / nut, excepts M3 is used for brook PCB.

###### Clear Plate

This plate is a transparent acylic that holds your artwork.
The artwork can also printed directly on this plate.
This plate is also hiding most of the screws on the top plate so the enclousure looks cleaner.

The thickness of clear plate depends on the snap-in button you planned to use.
If you decide to use a screw-in button, this part usually only affects the case's appearance. It has no functinoal usage and can be any thicknees or even removed.

###### Top Plate
Joystick and Buttons are either mounted on clear plate / top plate.
All screws on the top plate **MUST BE COUNTERSINK** when using a clear plate.

###### Brook PCB
The brook PCB can be mounted on the top plate / fixed to the back of top plate by magic tape.
An optional brook pcb standoff can be used if you want to screw the PCB to the top plate. It avoids the back of pcb directly touching the acylic (to avoid static electricity issues).

###### Front Side Plates
Screw-in buttons can be added on the front plate. They can be used as PS / HOME / OPTION / SELECT buttons.
A neutrik USB mounting hole will be placed at the center of it.
