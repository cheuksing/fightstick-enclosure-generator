Notes
-----
* Fightstick enclosure generator is free to use, and will remain free to use indefinitely.  
* It is open-source, which allows you to learn from (and contribute to) the tool.
* But it's not permissively licensed!
 * The long-term plan is to eventually open the license up to something really 
   permissive (probably MIT), when the site is closer to feature-complete.
 * In the near-term I would like to avoid forks of the website, since I feel it 
   would cause confusion in the community to have several similar-but-different 
   general-purpose layout editors available.
* I claim no ownership over the input (your fightstick layouts) or output (rendered 
cases).  You are free to use the inputs/outputs for any use whatsoever.
