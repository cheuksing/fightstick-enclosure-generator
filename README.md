Fightstick Enclosure Generator
----------------------
Welcome to the Fightstick Enclosure Generator (FEG), an open-source web application designed to simplify and enhance the customization of fightstick layouts. This tool allows you to modify the position and appearance of each physical button and joystick, providing a unique and personalized gaming experience.

### Motivation
The primary motivation behind the creation of FEG was to encourage gamers to explore and experiment with different fightstick layouts. We wanted to provide an easy and accessible platform for sharing these custom layouts within the gaming community.

### Easy Manufacturing
One of the key features of FEG is its focus on ease of manufacturing. The generated case designs are optimized for manufacturing through laser-cut acrylic, eliminating the need for hard-to-find parts. All you need are standard M3/M4 screws and nuts.
